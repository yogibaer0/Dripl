# AMEBA 🎨

**AMEBA** is a creator-first platform built around a modular hub + satellites UI system.

Each hub acts as a self-contained control center, and each satellite represents a tool or service that interacts with it — like extensions orbiting a creative workspace.

At the core of Ameba lives **Dripl Engine**, the first flagship satellite — a media conversion and management tool that powers link-based MP3/MP4 conversions and other creator utilities.
